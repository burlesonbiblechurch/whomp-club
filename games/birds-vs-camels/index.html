    <h1 id="toc_0">Birds vs. Camels</h1>

    <p><em>The name has very little to do with the game. Long story short, I asked a student to give me a name for the game before I even explained the rules. Now that’s what it’s called.</em></p>

    <h2 id="toc_1">Supplies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 Dodgeball</li>
      <li>1 Bat</li>
      <li>2 or more bases</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For dodgeballs, we use Little Tikes Mini Foam Soccer Balls. We buy them at Toys R Us for about $6 each. I have not found a good source for them online. They are 4.7&quot; diameter coated foam, and they are perfect for dodgeball. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Champion-Sports-Bounce-Dodgeball-6-Inch/dp/B000LXYKNO/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492889204&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rhino%2Bball&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Rhino dodgeballs</a> also might work, but they are more expensive and I doubt they will fly as far.</p>

    <p>For a bat, we use an empty <a href="http://store.awana.org/store/gamepins/96918,default,pd.html">Awana Game Pin</a>, but you could also use a jumbo Wiffle bat, a canoe paddle, or anything that has a wide enough surface to not require a lot of skill to hit the ball (not everyone is a baseball player).</p>

    <p>For bases, you can use hula hoops, printer paper, masking tape, or if you’re lucky enough to have a set of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/BSN-Orange-Throw-Bases-Piece/dp/B0010AP7HU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492892341&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rubber+baseball+bases">rubber throw down bases</a>, those work exceptionally well.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_2">Rules</h2>

    <h3 id="toc_3">Basic Rules</h3>

    <h4 id="toc_4">Playing field</h4>

    <p>You could play this outdoors, but I think it works better inside.  Select a location to be the pitching mound and home plate. Then place one or more  checkpoints (bases) around the room. (We call them “checkpoints”, because they are distinct from baseball bases in that you are never safe when on them).</p>

    <p>The more players you have, the fewer checkpoints you’ll want, since more checkpoints make the game more difficult.</p>

    <p>You may also designate foul lines, but I recommend being very generous to the batter since it keeps the action going.</p>

    <h4 id="toc_5">Teams</h4>

    <p>Divide players into two teams, Birds and Camels. There is nothing significant about the names, but that is what they are called. One team is up to bat, the other team is on the field and selects a pitcher for that inning.</p>

    <h4 id="toc_6">Batting</h4>

    <p>If your teams are small enough, let everyone on each team bat every inning. Otherwise, allow 5 or 6 outs. Once everyone has batted, that half of the inning is over and the batting team takes the field.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The player who is up to bat stands near home plate and waits for the pitch. There are no strikes or balls, the player is up until the ball is hit. </li>
      <li>Once the ball is hit, the player must run. They may run in any direction of their choosing.</li>
      <li>They must visit all checkpoints (in any order) and return to home plate before getting out in order to score a point.</li>
      <li>If a point is scored, the player is up to bat again until he or she is out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_7">Getting out</h4>

    <p>A player is out if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The ball is caught after being hit before striking any non-human object</li>
      <li>A fielder throws the ball and it, before striking any other object, hits the player</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_8">Field play</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Fielders may stand anywhere in the field prior to the pitch and move freely around the play area during play</li>
      <li>Once a fielder has possession of the ball, they may not move (pivoting is OK)</li>
      <li>This encourages teamwork between the fielders, since the ball must be passed to get closer to the runner.</li>
      <li>Fielders are encouraged to not physically block the runner’s path, but it’s hard to enforce since the runner may </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="toc_9">Alternate Rules</h3>

    <h4 id="toc_10">Catch and Release</h4>

    <p>In this version, the runner may attempt to catch the ball being thrown at them. If the ball is caught successfully, they can throw the ball in any direction in order to give themselves extra time to visit the checkpoints.</p>

    <h4 id="toc_11">Checkpoints as extra points</h4>

    <p>Instead of requiring all checkpoints to be visited before scoring a point, the player is only required to visit one. Any extra checkpoint visited during the run is counted as an extra point.</p>

    <h4 id="toc_12">Cutthroat Edition™</h4>

    <p>This works very well when there are 5 or fewer players. When there aren’t enough players to split into multiple teams, each person has an individual score for when they are up to bat, and all other players are in the field attempting to get that up to bat player out.</p>

    <p>Whoever pitches is on deck to bat next.</p>

    <h3 id="toc_13">Improvements</h3>

    <p>I’m looking for ways to improve the rules, such as motivation to not take a break between plays (either the same batter or a new batter) in order to keep the action moving. </p>
