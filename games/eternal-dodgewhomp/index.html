    <h2 id="toc_1">Supplies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>5 Whomps</li>
      <li>5 Dodgeballs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A whomp is a pool noodle cut in half.</p>

    <p>For dodgeballs, we use Little Tikes Mini Foam Soccer Balls. We buy them at Toys R Us for about $6 each. I have not found a good source for them online. They are 4.7&quot; diameter coated foam, and they are perfect for dodgeball. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Champion-Sports-Bounce-Dodgeball-6-Inch/dp/B000LXYKNO/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492889204&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rhino%2Bball&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Rhino dodgeballs</a> also work, but they are more expensive.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_2">Setup</h2>

    <p>One of the great things about this game is that it can be played just about anywhere with minimal setup. If you have a multi-use auditorium/gym, it actually works better to leave the chairs in place. Alternatively, stack the chairs but leave them scattered about. It&rsquo;s up to you! Different setups will give the game a slightly different flavor.</p>

    <p>Scatter whomps and dodgeballs around the playing area relatively evenly.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_3">Rules</h2>

    <h3 id="toc_4">1. Basic Rules</h3>

    <h4 id="toc_5">1.1 The Start</h4>

              <li><strong>1.3.1.1.2</strong> If opposing players strike each other at nearly exactly the same time, call a draw. Both players must abandon their whomps.</li>

      </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_9">1.5 Winning</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.5.1</strong> When only one player remains, he or she is the winner. This means that this player has gotten every other player out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="toc_10">2. Optional Rules</h3>

    <p>These rules are completely optional, but add a twist or new element to the game that provide different advantages for different types of players</p>

    <h4 id="toc_11">2.1 Golden Whomp</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.1.1</strong> elect one whomp of a different color (preferably in the yellow spectrum) to be the “Golden Whomp”</li>
      <li><strong>2.1.2</strong> The player who picks this whomp up may continue to use it until they are out

        <ul>
          <li>Watch out! This person usually become a target for everyone else since they wield so much power.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_12">2.2 Golden Ball</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.2.1</strong> Similar to the the golden whomp rules, select one ball of a different color to be the “Golden Ball”</li>
      <li><strong>2.2.2</strong> The player who picks this ball up does not have to remain in place and may move freely within the play area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_13">2.3 Lightning Round</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.3.1</strong> If you are limited on time, once you reach two minutes before the desired end time, call “Lightning round”, and everyone who is out goes back in.</li>
      <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> All the rules are the same, except one a player is out, there is no getting back in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_14">2.4 Team Play</h4>

    <p>Many times, alliances and teams form naturally during gameplay. My students haven’t enjoyed these official team play rules  as much as the individual rules.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.4.1</strong> Rules are the same, but when only one team is left in play, the game is over.</li>
    </ul>
